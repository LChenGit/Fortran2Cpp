! This Fortran program doesn't directly print or perform an operation that can be 
! unit tested for output without modifying the program's structure.
! The focus is on opening scratch files, which doesn't produce direct output 
! to test against. Instead, we ensure it runs without errors.

program open_files
  implicit none
  integer :: i

  do i = 1, 30
    ! Attempts to open a scratch file with each iteration.
    open(100+i, status="scratch")
  end do
end program open_files
