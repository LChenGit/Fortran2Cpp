This usually means that the `main` function is not defined in your source file. In Fortran, you don't typically use `main` like you do in C or C++. Instead, you have a subroutine that serves as the entry point.\n\nHere's an example of a simple Fortran program with a `main` subroutine:\n\n```fortran\nprogram my_program\n    implicit none\n    call my_subroutine()\nend program my_program\n\nsubroutine my_subroutine()\n    implicit none\n    print *, \"Hello, World!\"\nend subroutine my_subroutine\n```\n\nTo compile this program, you would typically use a command like:\n\n```sh\ngfortran -o my_program my_program.f90\n```\n\nMake sure that the `my_program.f90` file contains the `main` program and all other necessary functions, as shown in the example above.\n\nIf you are seeing the error message you posted, it means that the linker is not finding the `main` function. In Fortran, the entry point should be a `program` construct, not a `subroutine` or `function`.\n\nIf you need to include additional functions, you can define them within the same file, as shown in the example above. Here is a more complete example with multiple functions:\n\n```fortran\nmodule my_module\n    implicit none\ncontains\n    subroutine my_subroutine()\n        implicit none\n        print *, \"Hello, World!\"\n    end subroutine my_subroutine\n\n    subroutine another_subroutine()\n        implicit none\n        print *, \"This is another subroutine.\"\n    end subroutine another_subroutine\nend module my_module\n\nprogram my_program\n    implicit none\n    call my_subroutine()\n    call another_subroutine()\nend program my_program\n```\n\nWhen compiling this program, you would use:\n\n```sh\ngfortran -o my_program my_program.f90\n```\n\nMake sure that your `my_program.f90` file contains the entire program and all necessary subroutines or functions.

Compile the Fortran code.\n2. Compile the C++ code.\n3. Link the two together.\n\nHere's an example of how you can place all the functions into a single Fortran file and compile it using gfortran:\n\n```fortran\n! main.f90\nprogram main\n    use my_module\n    implicit none\n    call test_function()\nend program main\n\nmodule my_module\n    implicit none\ncontains\n    subroutine test_function()\n        print *, \"Hello from Fortran!\"\n    end subroutine test_function\nend module my_module\n```\n\nTo compile this with gfortran, use the following command:\n\n```sh\ngfortran -o main main.f90\n```\n\nThis command tells gfortran to compile `main.f90` into an executable named `main`.\n\nIf you need to include C++ code within your Fortran program, you can use a Fortran 2003 or later feature called \"ISO_C_BINDING\" to call C++ functions from Fortran. Here's an example:\n\n```fortran\n! main.f90\nprogram main\n    use my_module\n    implicit none\n    call test_function()\nend program main\n\nmodule my_module\n    use iso_c_binding\n    implicit none\ncontains\n    subroutine test_function()\n        print *, \"Hello from Fortran!\"\n    end subroutine test_function\nend module my_module\n```\n\nAnd the C++ code could be something like this:\n\n```cpp\n// my_module.cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nextern \"C\" {\n    void test_function() {\n        std::cout << \"Hello from C++!\" << std::endl;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo compile this with gfortran, you will need to specify that you are linking C++ code. You can do this by using the `-lstdc++` flag:\n\n```sh\ngfortran -o main main.f90 my_module.cpp -lstdc++\n```\n\nThis command tells gfortran to compile `main.f90` and `my_module.cpp` into an executable named `main`, and link against the C++ standard library.\n\nMake sure you have gfortran and a C++ compiler installed on your system. If you are using a different compiler, the flags and commands might differ slightly."

Here's an example:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cfortran.h>\n\nextern \"C\" {\n    void test_function();\n}\n\nvoid test_function() {\n    std::cout << \"Hello from Fortran!\" << std::endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    test_function();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nAnd the Fortran code could be something like this:\n\n```fortran\n! test_function.f90\nsubroutine test_function() bind(C, name=\"test_function\")\n    use, intrinsic :: ISO_C_BINDING\n    implicit none\n    print *, \"Hello from Fortran!\"\nend subroutine test_function\n```\n\nTo compile this with g++, you will need to specify that you are linking Fortran code. You can do this by using the `-lgfortran` flag:\n\n```sh\ng++ -o main main.cpp test_function.f90 -lgfortran\n```\n\nThis command tells g++ to compile `main.cpp` and `test_function.f90` into an executable named `main`, and link against the Fortran library.\n\nMake sure you have g++ and gfortran installed on your system. If you are using a different compiler, the flags and commands might differ slightly."

In C++, the `main` function is required to start the program. The error suggests that the linker is looking for `main` but cannot find it.\n\nSince you are working with a Fortran code and want to integrate it into a C++ environment, you need to ensure that your Fortran code also has an entry point that the C++ linker can recognize. Typically, this is done with a main program written in Fortran.\n\nHere is an example of how you can structure your Fortran and C++ code in the same file, including a main program in Fortran:\n\n```fortran\n! Fortran code\nmodule mymodule\n  implicit none\n  contains\n\n  function add(a, b) result(c)\n    integer, intent(in) :: a, b\n    integer :: c\n    c = a + b\n  end function add\n\nend module mymodule\n\nprogram main\n  use mymodule, only: add\n  implicit none\n  integer :: a, b, c\n  a = 5\n  b = 10\n  c = add(a, b)\n  print *, 'The sum is:', c\nend program main\n```\n\nIn this example, the Fortran code is encapsulated in a module `mymodule` and includes a main program that uses the `add` function defined in the module.\n\nTo compile this Fortran code with a C++ compiler and link it properly, you can use the following command:\n\n```sh\ng++ -o myprogram myprogram.f90\n```\n\nIf you need to compile and link with a specific Fortran compiler, you might need to specify the Fortran compiler explicitly, especially if you are using a different compiler than the default `gfortran`. For example, if you are using `ifort` (Intel Fortran Compiler):\n\n```sh\nifort -o myprogram myprogram.f90\n```\n\nThis command will compile the Fortran code and link it with the C++ compiler, ensuring that the entry point is correctly defined and recognized.\n\nPlease note that this approach assumes that the Fortran code and the C++ code are designed to work together in the same program. If the Fortran and C++ codes have different functionalities and are intended to be separate modules, you might need to refactor your code into separate files and use appropriate linking and importing mechanisms depending on your build system and environment."

In Fortran, the `main` function is typically implicit if you are using an execution section, but it must be present to be linked correctly.\n\nHere is a simple example of a Fortran program that includes a `main` function. This program defines a function to check if there are elements in an array that are close to each other (within a specified tolerance), and it includes a simple `main` function to test this functionality.\n\n```fortran\nprogram close_elements\n    implicit none\n    real, dimension(5) :: a = [1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0]\n    logical :: result\n\n    result = has_close_elements(a, 0.95)\n    if (result) then\n        write(*,*) \"Test case 2 passed\"\n    else\n        write(*,*) \"Test case 2 failed: assertion failed\"\n        call exit(1)\n    end if\n\ncontains\n\n    function has_close_elements(arr, tol) result(res)\n        real, intent(in) :: arr(:)\n        real, intent(in) :: tol\n        logical :: res\n        integer :: i\n\n        res = .false.\n        do i = 1, size(arr) - 1\n            if (abs(arr(i) - arr(i+1)) < tol) then\n                res = .true.\n                return\n            end if\n        end do\n    end function has_close_elements\n\nend program close_elements\n```\n\nIn this example, the `has_close_elements` function checks if any two consecutive elements in the array are within the specified tolerance. The `main` function tests this functionality with a sample array and a tolerance value.\n\nTo compile this Fortran code, you can use the following command:\n\n```sh\ngfortran -o close_elements close_elements.f90\n```\n\nThis command assumes that `close_elements.f90` is the file containing your Fortran code. The `-o close_elements` option specifies the name of the output executable.\n\nMake sure you have `gfortran` installed, as it is the Fortran compiler provided by the GNU project. If you don't have it, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install it with:\n\n```sh\nsudo apt-get install gfortran\n```\n\nThis should compile your Fortran code into an executable, and you can run it to see the test results."

This is because the `ld` (linker) is unable to find the `main` function, which is the entry point of a C++ program. In Fortran, the entry point is typically `start`, not `main`.\n\nHowever, to make your life easier, especially with unit testing, it's often better to separate the implementation and the test code into different files. This way, you can also include header files and make use of namespaces to avoid name clashes.\n\nThat said, if you want to keep everything in one Fortran file for simplicity, you need to ensure that you're calling the appropriate entry point for your C++ code. In C++, the entry point is indeed `main`. You might need to ensure that your Fortran code is linked with a C++ compiler and that the correct libraries are used.\n\nHere's an example of how you can structure your Fortran code and include the necessary C++ code. This example assumes you are using a C++ compiler to link your Fortran code.\n\n```fortran\n! my_module.f90\nmodule my_module\n    implicit none\n    private\n    public :: my_function\n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine my_function()\n        print *, \"Hello from Fortran!\"\n    end subroutine my_function\n\nend module my_module\n```\n\n```cpp\n// test.cpp\n#include <cassert>\n#include \"my_module.h\"  // Include the Fortran module's header\n\nint main() {\n    my_module::my_function();\n    assert(1 == 1);  // Passed test\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n```cpp\n// my_module.h\n#ifndef MY_MODULE_H\n#define MY_MODULE_H\n\nnamespace my_module {\n    void my_function();\n}\n\n#endif\n```\n\nFor the Fortran part, you would need to compile it with a Fortran compiler and include the necessary flags to link with the C++ compiler. For example, using `gfortran`:\n\n```sh\ngfortran -c my_module.f90 -o my_module.o\ng++ my_module.o test.cpp -o my_program\n./my_program\n```\n\nThis setup should work if your Fortran code is correctly set up to be linked with a C++ program. If you continue to face issues, double-check the compilation steps and ensure that all necessary libraries and flags are correctly set."

In Fortran, the entry point for a stand-alone program is typically named `main`. However, the error suggests that the compiler is looking for a `main` function but cannot find it.\n\nIf you want to keep all your functions in the same Fortran file, you need to ensure that there is a `main` subroutine defined. Here's an example of how you can structure your Fortran code:\n\n```fortran\nprogram my_program\n    call my_function()\nend program my_program\n\nsubroutine my_function()\n    print *, \"Hello from Fortran!\"\nend subroutine my_function\n```\n\nIn this example, `my_program` is the entry point of the program, and `my_function` is a subroutine that you want to test. To compile and link this Fortran code, you can use the following commands:\n\n```sh\ngfortran -o my_program my_program.f90\n```\n\nThis command will compile `my_program.f90` and create an executable named `my_program`.\n\nIf you want to include unit tests using `assert` as you mentioned, you can still do so by placing the `assert` statements in the `main` program. Since Fortran does not have a built-in `assert` function like C++, you might need to define your own simple `assert` function or use a macro. Here's an example with a simple `assert` function:\n\n```fortran\nprogram my_program\n    call my_function()\n    call assert(1 == 1, \"Assertion failed: 1 is not equal to 1\")\nend program my_program\n\nsubroutine my_function()\n    print *, \"Hello from Fortran!\"\nend subroutine my_function\n\nsubroutine assert(condition, message)\n    logical, intent(in) :: condition\n    character(len=*), intent(in) :: message\n\n    if (.not. condition) then\n        print *, \"Assertion failed: \", trim(message)\n        stop 1\n    end if\nend subroutine assert\n```\n\nThis code includes a simple `assert` subroutine that checks a condition and prints an error message if the condition is not met. The `stop 1` statement causes the program to terminate with a non-zero exit code, which is a common practice to indicate that an assertion failed.\n\nTo compile and run this Fortran code, use:\n\n```sh\ngfortran -o my_program my_program.f90\n./my_program\n```\n\nThis will compile `my_program.f90` and execute the program, printing \"Hello from Fortran!\" and then failing the assertion with the message \"Assertion failed: 1 is not equal to 1\"."

This typically happens when the function is not declared before it is used.\n\nTo resolve this, you need to declare the `my_function` function before you call it in the `main` function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```cpp\n#include <cassert>\n#include <iostream>\n\n// Declare the Fortran function\nextern \"C\" void my_function();\n\nint main() {\n    my_function();\n    assert(1 == 1);  // Passed test\n    return 0;\n}\n\n// Define the Fortran function\nextern \"C\" void my_function() {\n    std::cout << \"Hello from Fortran!\" << std::endl;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the `extern \"C\"` declaration is used to tell the compiler that the `my_function` is being called from C code, even though it is actually a Fortran function. This is necessary because the C++ and Fortran languages have different naming conventions for functions.\n\nThe `extern \"C\"` block is followed by the definition of the `my_function` function in the C++ file. This definition is necessary to provide the implementation of the function that will be called from the `main` function.\n\nTo compile and link this C++ code, you can use the following commands:\n\n```sh\ng++ -o my_program my_program.cpp\n```\n\nThis command will compile `my_program.cpp` and create an executable named `my_program`.\n\nNote that this approach relies on the fact that the Fortran function is available and correctly linked to the program. If you are using a modern Fortran compiler that supports the ISO C interface, you may not need to use `extern \"C\"` at all. However, the specific details of how to interface between Fortran and C can vary depending on the compiler and the environment. In the provided solution, the `extern \"C\"` declaration is a generic way to handle the interface, but you may need to adjust it based on the specific details of your Fortran compiler and environment."
